for (int i = 0; i < map.info.NumCells; i++)
{
    // Get the DeepResourceGrid cell data for the current index
    ThingDef resourceDef = deepResourceGrid.ThingDefAt(i); 

    if (resourceDef != null)
    {
        // A deep resource exists at this cell. 
        // You can check its definition and perform actions based on it.
        // Example:  
        if (resourceDef == ThingDefOf.Gold) // Check for gold resources
        {
            // Do something when gold is found at this cell
        }
    }
}

Specific Cell Search (Optional): If the coordinates (or Cell Index) of a specific location are known, you can directly query the DeepResourceGrid at that location.
csharp
IntVec3 targetCell = new IntVec3(x, y, z); // Replace x, y, z with desired coordinates
ThingDef resourceAtCell = deepResourceGrid.ThingDefAt(map.cellIndices.CellToIndex(targetCell)); 
if (resourceAtCell != null)
{
    // Resource found at targetCell
}



Known resources exhaused: Steel. Scan for more and update automatic drill's map by selecting steel. 
something along those lines.

yeah I could also do an icon over the miner, like of like the out of fuel thing

And maybe make it also drop resource selection when it goes idle due to no more pockets
so player has to reselect after scanning more pockets\




TO DO before concert:

reset targetcell function gizmo

look into how to multithread the map checker.

look into custom dictionary with a built in sorting method
